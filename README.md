# Recipe Hunter

This application is an assignment which I built to complete all the requirements for an award of certificate of completion on Ruby on Rails: An Introduction (Coursera).

## Background

Recipe hunter consumes [Recipe Puppy's](http://www.recipepuppy.com/) API. Recipe Puppy is an ingredient based recipe search engine that offers an API that returns recipes in JSON format.

Recipe Hunter:

1. Fetch the recipe information based on a search term entered in the address bar
2. Display the information in an HTML table - specifically, the **recipe photo**, the **recipe title** (both of which are links that can take you to the actual recipe) and the **ingredients** required for the recipe.

Something like below...

## Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

This template was tested with Ruby **2.6.3** and Ruby on Rails **4.2.11**.

#### How to test

1. Clone this repo - `git clone https://github.com/ODINAKACHUKWU/recipe_puppy_bootstrap.git`
2. Switch into the newly-cloned directory `cd recipe_puppy_bootstrap`
3. Run `bundle install` to install all the necessary gems
4. Start the server using the command `rails s`
5. Visit the site on your browser using `localhost:3000`
